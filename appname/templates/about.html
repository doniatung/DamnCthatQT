  <p class="lead">
    This is a website through which users can plan dates with their significant others,
    as well as functioning as a diary of sorts through which they can look through old dates.
    Upon creating an account, users will answer certain questions concerning how they enjoy
    spending their time, and we will use this data, along with the Eventbrite API to curate a
    homescreen with suggestions for potential date spots. Users are able to request information
    about a specific kind of event/action (like dinner, concert, etc), and the site will return
    a list of suggestions about where to find such activity. Once a user decides they would like
    to plan a given event for a date, they can select it to add onto their agenda. Once the date
    comes to pass, the user can upload pictures from that day or write a bit about how the date
    went.
